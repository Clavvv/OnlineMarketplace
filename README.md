### Documentation:
We heavily relied on documentation for using several technologies for which we had little to no experience.

For our database we decided to use a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL instance via NeonDB.

We used the documentation section for NextJS to get started setting up our DB connector and troubleshooting specifics, especially getting data from a 'RETURNING' clause inside a transaction.

We also pivoted to Typescript about halfway through the quarter and used [this](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to help with syntactic and formatting issues we ran into. After this project I will definitely be using Typescript over regular Javascript. Personally, the amount of time saved avoiding bugs by defining my API response and request structure dwarfed the annoyance of having to write more during variable definitions.
